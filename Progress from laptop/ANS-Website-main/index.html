            <h2 id="vision-header">Our Vision</h2>
            <p id="vision-paragraph">Our vision at All-Nighter Studios is to give power back to the players. Modern game studios revolve around stakeholders and sponsers, not the player. We understand that in order to make a successful game we must listen to you the player, not some stakeholders looking to get a return on investment, not people that don't even associate with gaming, and not people who are constantly looking for more ways of squeezing the players of their money. We are a studio made by gamers, for gamers. We want to make games that we would play ourselves, that you would play and enjoy, and most importantly respect your time and money. Through transparency, community engagement, and our dedication to quality, we aim to create masterful stories and unforgettable experiences, through thrilling highs and gut-wrenching lows, and a world that is alive all for you to explore. We are All-Nighter Studios, and we are here to change the game.</p>
